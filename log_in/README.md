<h4>In this project I have created a Login and SignUp/Register page, Home Page.  Firstly, user should Registered/SignUp after successful registration it will be redirected to the Login page where we can enter the login credentials e.g EmailId and Password whese EmailId and Password are cross checked and validated with the values entered in SignUp page.For storing and authentication the values enterd by user in SignUp page I have used Shared Preferences here. After validating the details it will direct to Home Page.</h4>

<h3>In side of Home page user can set an Image and dispaly it. User can only perform this action only once per day. If user tries to select and image user can't do that.After successful upload and updating of image the user can logout and redirected to the Login page </h3>
